 <h1>Password Manager</h1>

 <pre><code>
 # This is a simple password manager built using
 # Python and the cryptography library.
 # It allows you to add, retrieve, and delete
 # passwords for various services.

 # To get started, you'll need to install the
 # cryptography library. You can do this using pip:

 pip install cryptography

 # Once you've installed the library, you can run
 # the password manager using the following command:

 python password\_manager.py

 # This will bring up the command-line interface
 # for the password manager.

 # The password manager supports the following commands:

 # - generate-key: Generates a new encryption key.
 # - add [service] [username] [password]: Adds a new password
 # for a service.
 # - get [service]: Gets a password for a service.
 # - delete [service]: Deletes a password for a service.

 # When adding a new password, the password
 # manager generates a new encryption key and
 # stores it in memory. This key is used to
 # encrypt and decrypt the password, and is not
 # persisted to disk. To retrieve or delete a
 # password, you'll need to provide the encryption
 # key.

 # The password manager uses AES-256 encryption to
 # secure your passwords. However, it's important to
 # note that the encryption key is not persisted to
 # disk, so you'll need to keep track of it manually.
 # Additionally, uploading a password manager to a
 # public repository like GitHub could potentially
 # expose your passwords to unauthorized users, so
 # it's important to keep the repository private or
 # delete it after you've finished using the password
 # manager.
